SQLAlchemy Homework <br/>

"Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area."

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration (climate_starter.ipynb)
Python and SQLAlchemy were used to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database (hawaii.sqlite). All analysis was completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- Precipitation Analysis
- Station Analysis <br/>

## Step 2 - Climate App (app.py)
After completing initial analysis, A Flask API was created based on the queries created in Step 1.
